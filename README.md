## üöÄ Features

- **Automatic hardware detection**: CPU cores/threads, RAM, network speed, disk type
- **Multiple optimization profiles**: Choose from 10 specialized use cases
- **Container awareness**: Detects and adapts to container environments (Docker, LXC, Podman)
- **Manual parameter override**: Option to use custom hardware parameters
- **IPv6 configuration**: Option to enable or disable IPv6
- **Clear output**: Generates well-formatted and commented sysctl configuration
- **User-friendly interface**: Interactive command-line menu with guidance
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows exactly what was configured and why

## üíª Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ENGINYRING/sysctl-Generator.git

# Change directory
cd sysctl-Generator

# Make the script executable
chmod +x sysctlgen.sh
```

## üîß Usage

```bash
./sysctlgen.sh
```

The script will:
1. Detect your hardware configuration
2. Allow you to use detected or custom hardware parameters
3. Prompt you to select a use case
4. Configure IPv6 settings
5. Generate an optimized sysctl.conf file
6. Provide instructions for applying the configuration

## üìä Use Cases

The script supports the following optimization profiles:

1. **General Purpose**: Balanced tuning for mixed workloads
2. **Virtualization Host**: Optimized for hypervisors (KVM/QEMU/Proxmox/ESXi)
3. **Web Server**: Tuned for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and web applications
4. **Database Server**: Optimized for MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB/etc.
5. **Caching Server**: Performance-tuned for Redis/Memcached/etc.
6. **HPC / Compute Node**: For computational and scientific workloads
7. **File Server**: Optimized for NFS/SMB/file storage operations
8. **Network Appliance**: For routers/firewalls/gateways/proxies
9. **Container Host**: Specialized for Docker/Kubernetes nodes
10. **Development Machine**: Balanced for coding workstations

## üìù Example Output

The generated configuration file includes a detailed header and organized parameter sections:

```
# Optimized sysctl.conf for Web Server
# Hardware: 8 cores / 16 threads, 32GB RAM, 1000Mb/s NIC, SSD
# Generated on: 2025-05-15 14:22:33
#
# Apply changes with: sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
#
# IMPORTANT: Test these settings with your specific workload.
#
fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576
fs.file-max = 33554432
fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 8192
...
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Detection

The script automatically detects:

- **CPU**: Number of cores and threads
- **RAM**: Available system memory in GB
- **Network**: Active interface speed in Mbps
- **Disk**: Type (HDD, SSD, or NVMe)

You can also manually specify hardware parameters if the automatic detection doesn't match your requirements or if you want to generate a configuration for a different system.

## üê≥ Container Support

sysctl-Generator detects if it's running inside a container environment and adapts accordingly:

- Identifies Docker, LXC, and Podman containers
- Adjusts resource calculations based on container limits
- Provides container-specific optimizations
- Warns about parameters that require host-level privileges

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Bash shell
- Root access (for applying the generated configuration)
- Optional tools that improve detection accuracy:
  - `ethtool` (for better network speed detection)
  - `lsblk` (for disk type detection)
  - `bc` (for more precise calculations)

## üîí Security Considerations

While the script generates optimal parameters for performance, some system environments may require additional security-focused tuning. Always review the generated configuration before applying it to production systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- ENGINYRING is **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for any system instability, performance issues, data loss, or any other problems that may arise from using this tool or applying the generated configurations.
- Always **TEST CONFIGURATIONS** in a non-production environment before deploying to production systems.
- The generated parameters are **RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY** and should be reviewed by a system administrator with knowledge of the specific environment.
- We **DO NOT GUARANTEE** performance improvements or system stability with these configurations.
- By using this tool, you acknowledge that you are making changes to system parameters **AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
- **ALWAYS BACKUP** your original configuration before applying any changes.
